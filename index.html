      <h2>How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly</h2>

      <p>
        Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing
        sport, face challenges and quit it in a few weeks or even days. Why does
        it happen? The problem is that people often do too much physical
        activity when their body is not ready for this load. Without allowing
        any recovery time between exercise sessions, they get tired quickly and
        lose motivation. We believe that you should have a smooth start and
        focus on developing a habit of doing sport regularly. So, we offer you a
        few training programs for beginners.
